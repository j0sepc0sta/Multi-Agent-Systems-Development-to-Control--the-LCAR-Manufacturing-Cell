# Multi-Agent-Systems-Development-to-Control--the-LCAR-Manufacturing-Cell
The Thesis aims to develop a monitoring and control system for the small-scale production system located at the Laboratório de Controlo, Automação e Robótica (LCAR) of the Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gestão (ESTiG) of the Instituto Politécnico de Bragança (IPB).

The development will be carried out using agent systems technology, specifically the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE). 

In simplified terms, distributed software\index{Distributed Systems|main} components will be designed and developed to represent the existing physical components, particularly the production machines and the e IRB 1400 ABB robot for handling. 

The interactions between the various agents will also be designed to support the realization of product production tasks, simulating a control system. Each agent will also send information about the state and other variables of the system, realizing the monitoring functionality.
