The Thesis aims to develop a monitoring and control system for the small-scale
production system located at the Laboratório de Controlo, Automação e Robótica
(LCAR) of the Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gestão (ESTiG) of the Instituto
Politécnico de Bragança (IPB).

The development will be carried out using agent systems technology, specifically
the JADE.

In simplified terms, distributed software components will be designed and developed to represent the existing physical components, particularly the Fischertechnik
production machines and the e IRB 1400 ABB Robot for handling.

The interactions between the various agents will also be designed to support
the realization of product production tasks, simulating a control system . Each
agent will also send information about the state and other variables of the system,
realizing the monitoring functionality.
